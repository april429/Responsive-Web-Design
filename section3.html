        Now I want to investigate some possible impacts on society for two groups below:
        <ul><li>Who could benefit from this?</li></ul>
        <p>Genral public including students, teachers, workers, and etc who are using
            smartphones or any internet-based devices.
            Especially police could tremendous benefit from it simce it gives live
            traces through uploaded picture by public.
        </p>
        <ul><li>Who could be harmed by this?</li></ul>
        <p>Since this service has to be connected to the internet,
        those who do not carry or have internet-connected device would not get any
        information through this.
        </p>
        <p>
        Overall however, this project is meant for informative to public safety,
        majority people will get benefit from it.
